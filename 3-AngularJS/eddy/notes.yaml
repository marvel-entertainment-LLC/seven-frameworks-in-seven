AngularJS notes:
- Day 1
    - bootstrap order: module > service(s)
    - automatically handles the low leve ajax requests for data exchange
    this implies that your REST service needs to implement
    AngularJS spec for a restful service
    - resource service understands object attribute placeholders, e.g. @id
    - not really understanding the test methodology when working with http requests

    How to create/define a service:
    - app.service
    - app.factory
    - app.provider(name, Object|function() )

    Exercise:
    - rant: have to figure out how to accomplish the self study exercise given
      the available sample code, note it's all already implemented somewhere already
      and touches on uncovered topics, like controllers/filters, yay fun!
